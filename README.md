# Coin-Problem
A library used to study the coin problem, Frobenius numbers, and Frobenius symmetry.
quads.py can be used to generate a databse while dataBase.py can be used to load and query it.
I have generated several databses, one of which (200quad.txt) took roughly a week but is far too large to share here.
Please visit http://www.dglassreviews.com/database.html to save time regenerating these files. 
If you generate a larger one than I have already, I would be very interested to have access and host it with others.
