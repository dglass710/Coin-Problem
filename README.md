# Coin-Problem
A library used to study the coin problem, Frobenius numbers, and Frobenius symmetry.
quads.py can be used to generate a databse while dataBase.py can be used to load and query it.
I have generated several databses, one of which (200quad.txt) took roughly a week but is far too large to share here.
Please visit http://www.dglassreviews.com/database.html to save time regenerating these files. 
If you generate a larger one than I have already, I would be very interested to have access and host it with others. 
quads.py and dataBase.py both have just one line at the module level. 
This function call if all that is required for the program to run to completeness. 
Read the appropriate function doc string and comments for more information about usage and implimentation.
