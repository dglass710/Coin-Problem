# Coin-Problem
A library used to study the coin problem, Frobenius numbers, and Frobenius symmetry
quads.py can be used to generate a databse while dataBase.py can be used to load and query it
I have generated several databses, one of which (200quad.txt) took roughly a week but is far too large to share here 
If I set up another location where those can be downloaded, I plan to update this and include a link
